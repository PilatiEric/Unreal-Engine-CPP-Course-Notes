	HOW TO START THE GAME FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE IN THE LEVEL
	- Right click on any surface and click "Play From Here"
	- WARNING: If there are spaces in an object that let's you see behind it, CLICK ON THE OBJECT, NOT THE SPACES
		- If you click on the spaces, you'll appear behind the object on whatever surface you clicked on

	FOR FIGURING OUT HOW FAR TO SET A MOVING OBJECT TO GO
	- Look at where the Location is in the details panel
	- Drag the object to where you want it to go and record the difference between the two Locations
	- Use that as the distance

	FOR MAKING IT EASIER TO PLACE OBJECT NEAR WHERE A MOVING OBJECT WILL GO
	- Take another object and stick it next to where the moving object is before returning the moving object to its starting position
