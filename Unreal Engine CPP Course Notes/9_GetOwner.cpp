	WHAT IS AN OWNER
	- The owner is the object/actor/etc. that contains the component
		- The door we made is the owner of the Mover component in it

	THE GETOWNER() FUNCTION
	- Returns a pointer to the AActor that owns the component
	- More information on GetOwner() in Actor_Info_Functions.cpp
	- The most important thing is this lets us access the AActor's functions and members
