	We are going to add a platform to our moving platform component

	HOW TO SET THE ACTOR LOCATION IN UNREAL
	- Click on the MovingPlatform component on the right side
	- Look under the Details section on the right side
	- Click "Add"
	- When the list of selections pops up, click "Cube"
	-The MovingPlatform now should have a Transform section

	The first item (cube) added to a component (MovingPlaform) becomes the "Root Component"


	USING THE SetActorLocation()
	- All notes are in the Actor_Transform_Functions.cpp
