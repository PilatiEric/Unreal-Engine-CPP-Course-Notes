	WHAT IS A MATERIAL
	- Determines how a Mesh looks

	HOW TO SET A MATERIAL
	- Find the material in your Content Browser
	- Click and drag it to the item you want it applied to
	- In the item's Details panel, it can be found in the "Surface Materials" section
		- You can pick a different material from the dropdown list in it as well
	

	ADDING MORE MATERIALS AND OTHER STUFF AVAILABLE
	- We're going to get the "Starter Content Asset Pack"
	- In the Content Browser, while in the Content folder, click "Add"
	- In the menu, click "Add Feature or Content Pack..."
	- In the panel that pops up, click "Content" at the top
		- Is next to "Blueprint" and "C++"
	- Click "Starter Content"
	- Click "Add to Project" at the bottom
	- Once it is done and the "StarterContent" folder is added to the Content folder, close the panel


	WHEN APPLYING THE MATERIAL TO A SHAPE
	- Only the side you dragged the material to will change
	- To add the material faster, select the material you want, then add the object in

	IF YOU WANT TO HOLLOW OUT AN OBJECT
	- This requires the object to be a Geometry Brush object
	- Go into the Details menu
	- Go down to the "Brush Settings" section
	- Check the box for "Hollow"
	- Use the "Wall Thickness" number to determine how thick the walls are
