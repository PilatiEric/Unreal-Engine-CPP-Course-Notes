	Live coding let's us compile code without exiting the editor or using Visual Studio

	HOW TO START LIVE CODING
	- There's a button at the bottom of the Unreal Engine screen towards the right that looks like a bunch of blocks stacked on each other with more floating towards it
		- Next to the "All Saved" words
	- Make a change in your code in Visual Studio, save it, then press this button
	- A box should pop up and should tell you that Live Coding Succeeded
		- If there is an error in your code
			- You'll get a red message in the Live Coding window that says "Build failed."



	RULES OF THUMB
	- Best used only when making changes to .cpp files
		- Not .h files
			- You should close Unreal Engine and rebuild the solution in Visual Studio for these
	- Recompile your C++ solution at the start or end of your work session
