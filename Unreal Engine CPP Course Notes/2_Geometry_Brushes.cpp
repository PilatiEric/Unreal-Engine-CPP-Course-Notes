	GEOMETRY SELECTIONS LOCATION
	- Is found in a tab found when clicking on the "Quickly add to the project" button

	- Found on the right side under "Brush Settings" after clicking on an item
	- Brush Type (VERY IMPORTANT AND WHY GEOMETRY BRUSHES ARE SO POWERFUL)

			- Additive adds tangible shapes that the character can interact with
			- Subtractive add intangible shapes or, in other words, subtracts those shapes from the tangible (additive) ones
